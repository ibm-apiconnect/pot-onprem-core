      summary: Request Access Tokens
      description: >
        This endpoint allows requesting an access token following one of the
        flows below:

        - Authorization Code (exchange code for access token)

        - Client Credentials (2-legged, there isnt resource owner information)

        - Resource Owner Password Credentials (2-legged, client provides resource
        owner name and password)

        - Refresh Token (exchange refresh token for a new access code)





        The table below indicates the required parameters for each specific
        grant_type options.

        Empty cells indicate a parameter is ignored for that specific grant
        type.





        Client authentication:

        - Confidential clients should authenticate using HTTP Basic
        Authentication. Alternatively, they may post



          their client_id and client_secret information as a formData parameter.



        - Public clients should send their client_id as formData parameter.
